# Even Odd Array Problem
## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers, the task is to rearrange the array such that all even numbers appear at the beginning, maintaining their relative order, followed by odd numbers. The sorting should be done in-place, using only a constant amount of extra space.

## Example
For example, given the array:

```
[3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7, 8]
```

The sorted array should be:

```
[2, 4, 6, 8, 3, 1, 5, 7]
```
